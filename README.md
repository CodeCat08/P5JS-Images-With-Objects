# P5JS-Images-With-Objects üê±
This program associates images with bubble objects. Bubbles are given a "pic" property which is a randomly assigned ".jpg" file. When a bubble object is clicked, the bubble's image is re-rolled. The newer "template literal" is used to get the file path of the images inside a for-loop.

## How to use:
